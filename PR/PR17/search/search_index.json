You are sharing this resources with a number of other researchers, staff, and students, so it is important that you read this page and use the system as intended.</p> <p>Being a cluster, there are several machines connected together with a network. We refer to these as nodes. Most nodes in the cluster are referred to as compute nodes, this is where the computation is done on the system (where you will run your code). When you ssh into the system you are on a special purpose node called the login node. The login node, as its name suggests, is where you log in and is for editing code and files, installing packages and software, downloading data, and starting jobs to run your code on one of the compute nodes.</p> <p>Each job is started using a piece of software called the scheduler, which you can think of as a resource manager. You let it know what resources you need and what you want to run, and the scheduler will find those resources and start your job on them. When your job completes those resources are relinquished. The scheduler is what ensures that no two jobs are using the same resources, so it is very important not to run anything unless it is submitted properly through the scheduler.</p>","tags":["Getting Started","Linux"]},{"location":"getting_started/#software-and-packages","title":"Software and Packages","text":"<p>The first thing you may want to do is make sure the system has the software and packages you need. We have installed a lot of software and packages on the system already, even though it may not be immediately obvious that it is there. AICR uses modules to manage software, which should be similar to your home institution's system. AICR as a common set of core modules shared across institutions, as well as institution-specific modules whose naming and layout may be more familiar to you. Institution-specific modules are available to all AICR users, but may be hidden by default.</p> <p>Run <code>module avail</code> to see the default set of modules available to you. You can load a module with the <code>module load</code> command. Please see the Software page for more information.</p> <p>If you are ever unsure if we have a particular software, and you cannot find it, you can try installing it in your home directory. If you need help, please send us an email and ask before you spend a lot of time trying to install it. If we have it, we can point you to it, provide advice on how to use it, and if we don't have it we can often give pointers on how to install it. Further, if a lot of people request the same software, we may consider adding it as a module.</p>","tags":["Getting Started","Linux"]},{"location":"getting_started/#linux-command-line","title":"Linux Command Line","text":"<p>Every ORCD system runs Linux, so much of what you do on the cluster involves the Linux command line. That doesn't mean you have to be a Linux expert to use the system! However the more you can get comfortable with the Linux command line and a handful of basic commands, the easier using the system will be. If you are already familiar with Linux, feel free to skip this section, or skim as a refresher.</p> <p>Most Linux commands deal with directories and files. A directory, synonymous to a folder, contains files and other directories. The list of directories that lead to a particular directory or file is called its path. In Linux, directories on a path are separated by forward slashes <code>/</code>. It is also important to note that everything in Linux is case sensitive, so a file <code>myScript.sh</code> is not the same as the file <code>myscript.sh</code>. When you first log in, you are in your home directory. Your home directory is where you can put all the code and data you need to run your job. Your home directory is not accessible to other users, so if you need a space to share files with other users, use a project directgory.</p> <p>The path to your home directory on AICR is <code>/home/&lt;USERNAME&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;USERNAME&gt;</code> is your username. The character <code>~</code> is also shorthand for your home directory in any Linux commands.</p> <p>Anytime after you start typing a Linux command you can press the \"Tab\" button your your keyboard. This called tab-complete, and will try to autocomplete what you are typing. This is particularly helpful when typing out long directory paths and file names. Pressing \"Tab\" once will complete if there is a single completion, pressing it twice will list all potential completions. It is a bit difficult to explain in text, but you can try it out yourself and watch the short demonstration here.</p> <p>Finally, click on the box below for a list of Linux Commands. If you are new to Linux try them out for yourself at the command line.</p> Common Linux Commands <ul> <li>Creating, navigating and viewing directories:<ul> <li><code>pwd</code>: tells you the full path of the directory you are     currently in</li> <li><code>mkdir dirname</code>: creates a directory with the name \"dirname\"</li> <li><code>cd dirname</code>: change directory to directory \"dirname\"<ul> <li><code>cd ../</code>: takes you up one level</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>ls</code>: lists the files in the directory<ul> <li><code>ls -a</code>: lists all files including hidden files</li> <li><code>ls -l</code>: lists files in \"long format\" including ownership     and date of last update</li> <li><code>ls -t</code>: lists files by date stamp, most recently updated     file first</li> <li><code>ls -tr</code>: lists files by dates stamp in reverse order, most     recently updated file is listed last (this is useful if you     have a lot of files, you want to know which file you changed     last and the list of files results in a scrolling window)</li> <li><code>ls dirname</code>: lists the files in the directory \"dirname\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Viewing files<ul> <li><code>more filename</code>: shows the first part of a file, hitting the     space bar allows you to scroll through the rest of the file, q     will cause you to exit out of the file.</li> <li><code>less filename</code>: allows you to scroll through the file, forward     and backward, using the arrow keys.</li> <li><code>tail filename</code>: shows the last 10 lines of a file (useful when     you are monitoring a log file or output file to see that the     values are correct)<ul> <li><code>tail &lt;number&gt; filename</code>: show you the last &lt;number&gt;     lines of a file.</li> <li><code>tail -f filename</code>: shows you new lines as they are written     to the end of the file. Press CMD+C or Control+C to exit.     This is helpful to monitor the log file of a batch job.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files<ul> <li><code>mv filename dirname</code>: moves filename to directory dirname.<ul> <li><code>mv filename1 filename2</code>: moves filename1 to filename2, in     essence renames the file. The date and time are not changed     by the mv command.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>cp filename dirname</code>: copies to directory dirname.<ul> <li><code>cp filename1 filename2</code>: copies filename1 to filename2. The     date stamp on filename2 will be the date/time that the file     was moved</li> <li><code>cp -r dirname1 dirname2</code>: copies directory dirname1 and its     contents to dirname2.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>rm filename</code>: removes (deletes) the file</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["Getting Started","Linux"]},{"location":"getting_started/#transferring-files","title":"Transferring Files","text":"<p>One of the first tasks is to get your code, data, and any other files you need into your home directory on the system. If your code is in github you can use git commands on the system to clone your repository to your home directory. The primary method we recommend for copying your files to and from AICR is through Globus. You can also transfer your files from your computer using the OnDemand File Browser or by using the commands <code>scp</code> or <code>rsync</code>.</p> <p>You can use <code>scp</code> or <code>rsync</code> from the command line on your local computer. Both commands work similarly to the <code>cp</code> command, following the pattern <code>&lt;command&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</code>, the only difference being that you will need to include the hostname of the system you are transferring to or from. For this reason you must run this command from the terminal on your computer before you've logged in.</p> <p>To transfer a file from your computer to AICR:</p> <pre><code>scp &lt;local-file-name&gt; USERNAME@[aicr-login-hostname]:&lt;path-to-aicr-dir&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>To transfer a file from an ORCD system to your computer:</p> <pre><code>scp USERNAME@[aicr-login-hostname]:&lt;path-to-supercloud-dir&gt;/&lt;file-name&gt; &lt;path-to-local-dest&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Similar to <code>cp</code>, use the <code>-r</code> flag to copy over an entire directory and its contents. </p> <pre><code>scp -r &lt;local-dir-name&gt; USERNAME@[aicr-login-hostname]:&lt;path-to-supercloud-dir&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>rsync</code> command can be used similarly and has some additional flags you can use.
